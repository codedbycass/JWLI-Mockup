# JWLI-Mockup
For this project I simply looked at a wireframe and recreated it with HTML and CSS. I added media queries to ensure responsive design across multiple devices.

## How it's made
This site was made with HTML and CSS. I used media queries at several different breakpoints to make it responsive.

## Lessons Learned
Media queries aren't just about resposive design, but information hierarchy. I was able to deploy certain design choices based on what I determined to be important information to users.
